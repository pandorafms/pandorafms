### What is Pandora FMS?

### Other things Pandora FMS can do

Pandora FMS can measure performances, compare values among different systems and set alarms over thresholds. Pandora FMS works against a Database so it can generate reports, statistics, SLA and measure anything: OS, applications and hardware systems, such as firewalls, proxies, Databases, web servers, VPN, routers, switches, processes, services, [remote accesses to servers](https://pandorafms.com/server-monitoring/), etc. Everything integrated in an open and distributed architecture. Pandora FMS can be deployed over any OS, with specific agents for each platform. There are agents for Windows (2000, XP, 2003), GNU/Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, BSD, AIX, IPSO and OpenWRT.
