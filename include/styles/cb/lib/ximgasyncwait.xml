<description><![CDATA[Asynchronously waits (and monitors the status) of newly created or static images. Can be called before or after window.onload, or in the HTML following the last IMG element. During monitoring of image load status, your status function will be called at each iteration. After all images successfully load, your app initialization function is called. If any image fails to load, your error function is called. You can provide error and abort images for those that fail to load.]]></description>
