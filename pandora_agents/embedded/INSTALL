Build and link Pandora FMS Embedded Agent
-----------------------------------------

To build Pandora FMS you need to have binary and developer packages
for:

  * GNU C extensions (standard in linux, not in AIX or Solaris).
  * autotools (autoconf, automake, pkg-config, etc...)

In a ubuntu/debian linux package names are 

  * autoconf
  * automake1.9
  * pkg-config

Cross compiling
---------------

Edit apt sources (debian only, sorry!)

  deb http://www.emdebian.org/debian/ lenny main

Download a specific packages for crosscompiling (in my case ARM for GCC-4.3)

   apt-get install g++-4.3-arm-linux-gnueabi gcc-4.3-arm-linux-gnueabi libc6-armel-cross \
   libc6-dev-armel-cross libgcc1-armel-cross libstdc++6-4.3-dev-armel-cross \
   libstdc++6-4.3-pic-armel-cross linux-libc-dev-armel-cross zlib1g-armel-cross
  
Build for ARM: 

   ./configure --host=arm-linuxº
   ./make 

Check your GCC version is using the ARM binary.

Basic installation
--------------

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Installation Names
------------------

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/etc', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'. Make install will install these files by default

  /usr/local/etc/pandora/pandora_agent.conf
  /usr/local/bin/pandora/pandora_agent


   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
