What is Pandora FMS?
--------------------

Pandora FMS is a monitoring application to watch systems and applications.
Pandora FMS allows to know the status of any element of your bussiness systems.
Pandora FMS watches your hardware, your software, your multilayer system and, of
course, your Operating System. Pandora FMS can detect a network interface down
or the movement of any NASDAQ new technology market value. If you wish, Pandora
FMS can send a SMS message when your system or your application fails... or when
Google stock value drops below 330 US$.

Pandora FMS will adjust, like an octopus, to your systems and requirements,
because it has been designed to be open, modular, multiplattform and easy to
customize. Pandora FMS is developed for system administrators.
