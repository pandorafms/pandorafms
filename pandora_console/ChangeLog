	db_info.php so I removed it and included the contents in db_info

	* godmode/db/db_purge.php: Since we went over the threshhold of 1,5M
	data entries on a P4, the page would timeout from the browser out. So
	I reworked the page to clarify the variables and adhere to style. Put
	the delete query in a transaction (since it might be that either
	timeouts or other errors don't clean the whole database up and then
	you have to do it manually. Code is also prettier now.

	repeating the string.

	* estado_grupo.php: Detect old "OK" monitors, but doesnt check if they are down 
	in time, so for example, a old monitor with OK signal but from a week old, it is

	Now counts data modules for DOWN total account, and show grey button if ANY
	type of module is down, not only monitors. Improved SQL searches.

	included in total account, more accurate accounting. A new value shown in grey for 
	DOWN modules, being monitors or single data modules, no matter type. Improved SQL 
	searches. Individual module intervals are used to determine if a module is down, 
	if there is no individual module interval, global agent interval is used. 
	Now it's possible to have a module with higher interval than Agent interval, so 
	we take now the more higest interval in modules to calculate if an agent is DOWN.
