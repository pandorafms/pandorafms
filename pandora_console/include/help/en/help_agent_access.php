<h1>Agent access</h1>

Agent access graphs provide access to ”contacts" per hour in a graph with a 24hr (daily) scale. This can be used to know the contact frequency for each agent. This could be useful to detect bottlenecks and agent breakdowns. This could be time-consuming and if you're short on resources, this option can be deactivated on the application’s main setup.
