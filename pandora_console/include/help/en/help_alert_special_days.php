<h1>List of special days</h1>

<p>Allows defining special days, holidays and special work days, for alert templates. They are treated as the same day of the week you selected.</p>

<p>For example, let’s suppose that the 3rd of May 2012 is a holiday. When we define ’03-05-2012’ as a ‘Sunday’, this day will be treated as if it were a Sunday. The date format is YYYY-MM-DD. If the year has to remain unspecified, YYYY can be replaced by ‘*’.
</p>

<p>
Note: To enable the list of special days, "Use list of special days” should be enabled on the alert’s template (step2).
