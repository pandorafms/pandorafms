<h1>Module definition</h1>

There are two modes for an agent:
<ul>
    <li>Learning mode: all the modules sent by the agent are accepted. If modules are not deﬁned, they will be automatically deﬁned by the system. It is recommended to activate the agents in this mode and change it once the user is familiar with Pandora FMS.</li>
    <li>Normal mode: the modules in this mode must be conﬁgured manually. The self deﬁnition of the modules is not allowed in this mode.</li>
</ul>
