<h1>Network Component</h1>

The Network Component combo box allows you to select a template from a list of more than a hundred and automatically fill some fields with the typical values.
<br /><br />
To do so, select the template you want, click on "Get data" and wait few seconds until the information is filled. Depending on the template, some fields will be filled in and some others will not, for example:
<ul>
	<li>TCP port would be filled for "Check FTP Server" but not SNMP OID</li>
	<li>TCP port would not be filled for "Catalyst CPU Usage (5min)" but SNMP OID will.</li>
</ul>
