<h1>GIS Connection Configurations</h1>

This page is the place where the admin can configure <strong>connections to GIS Map Servers</strong>.

Here it is possible to see the list of defined connections, <strong>edit</strong> any one of them by clicking on their name, <strong>delete</strong> any connection by clicking on the delete icon (<?php html_print_image('images/delete.svg', false, ['alt' => 'delete icon']); ?>) or <strong>create</strong> new connections using the create button.
