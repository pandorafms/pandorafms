  <title>Agents</title>

  <para>
    The agents collect information. There are agents based on a software 
    agent and installed in the System to monitor, and network agents - a 
    non-physical agent, without need of installing any software, that 
    executes network tasks in Pandora Network servers and shows 
    information on console.
  </para>
  <para>
    For agents who need to install software into remote systems,
    public key of the machine to be monitored needs to be copied into
    Pandora Data server in order to be able to collect data, as it is specified
    in detail in Pandora Install documentation.
  </para>
  <para>
    Data collected from the agents are stored in small pieces of
    information called "modules". Each module stores only a kind of
    data. The value of each module is the value of one monitored
    variable. The agent must be activated in Pandora Server and a
    group assigned to the agent. The data then begin to be
    consolidated in the database and can be accessed.
  </para>
  <para>
    A network agent NEEDs to be assigned to a Network Server to
    execute network tasks. If you cannot see any Network Servers it's
    because you don't have any Network Server running. Please configure
    and run a Network Server before trying to assign a network module
    to an Agent.

      You can define new agents. Once defined in Pandora console, it is

      on software installed in a remote machine), or from Network
      Agents (assined to a Network Server who runs network tasks to

      Please remember that a network agent NEEDs to be assigned to a
