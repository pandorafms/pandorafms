	<title>Incident management</title>

	<para>
	The system monitoring process needs to follow up the incidents 
	arising in the system besides receiving and processing the data to be 
	monitored in each time interval
	</para>

	<para>
	Pandora uses a tool called Incident Manager for this task, where 
	each user can open an incident, where a description of what happened 
	in the network is shown. This can be completed with comments and files
	when necessary.
	</para>

	<para>
	This system is designed for group work. Different roles and
	workflow systems permit to move incidents from one group to another. 
	The system allows different groups and different users to work on
	the same incident, sharing information and files.
	</para>

	<para>
	Clicking on "Manage Incidents", in the Operation menu, a list 
	showing all the incidents is displayed, ordered by the date-time they
	were last updated. Filters can be applied to display only those
	incidents the user is interested on.
	</para>

	<graphic fileref="images/image034.png" valign="bottom" align="center"/>

	The filters that can be applied are:

		<title>Searching for an incident</title>

		<para>A specific incident can be found amongst the incidents created

		<para>Any text string included as a sub-string in the

		string in the Incident title as well as in the text contained by the incident.
		The search engine will not search neither the Comments added to the agent nor
		the attached files. The search can be performed in addition to group, priority
		or status filters.</para>
