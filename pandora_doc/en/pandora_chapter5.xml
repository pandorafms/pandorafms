	<para>
	  An event in Pandora is any unusual change happend in an
	  agent.
	</para>
	<para>
	  An event is registered when an agent is down or starts up,
	  when a monitor fails or changes its status, or when an alarm
	  is sent.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An event is usually preceded by an issue with the system
	  being monitored. A validation and deletion system has been
	  created to avoid leaving unanalised issues, so they can be
	  easily validated or deleted if the problem can be ignored or
	  it's been already solved.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The events appear ordered chronologically as they enter the
	  system, and can be viewed by clicking the "View Events"
	  option in the Operation menu.  The newer events are placed
	  at the top of the table.
	</para>
