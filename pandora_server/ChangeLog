	guide.

2007-12-04  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	*  lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network: This little portion of
	code should fix problem detected in some very extrange module "blackout" 
	effect reported by Corona. Need check and testing before get as final.

2007-11-20  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* pandora_snmpconsole,pandora_server,pandora_recon,pandora_network: Fixed
	  bug #1822659.

2007-11-19  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

2007-10-09  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_snmpconfole: Fixed parameter for snmptrapd call (%a instead %B). This
	was causing problems (do not detect IP Address) on Redhat systems.

2007-10-08  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated build number.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed some problems with alert recovery/expired method, 
	that causes to do not recognize expired alerts in some situations (min_alert=0).

2007-10-04  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed a missing $ in sub header definition for args :( 
	and some warnings also fixed.

	* conf/pandora_server.conf, lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network:

	Merged code from NG branch: Added multiping check (global setting 'icmp_checks')
	on network server because in some WAN enviroments with erratic packet loss on non TCP
	connections would cause recurrent false positives. New config token added to config
	file (icmp_checks).

2007-10-03  Sancho lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed alert that fires always one time more than
	max_alert defined. Also fixed several issues with "Ceased" support for alerts
	and correct internal_counter problem. Now works fine !

	* util/pandora_db.pl: Purge of tagent_access was not working fine, and fixed
	another problem with id_agent 0 data in tagente_datos.

	After about 12 hours of intense testing this seems to work very fine, probably
	this server code will be the final ! :-)

2007-10-02  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Updated and fixed several problems with alerts. 
	Now notification of alert ceased is properly implemented and works
	inside threshold timegap. Event are fired using alert description and not
	alert type, and automatically ceased alerts (depending on min_alert and 
	internal counter) give up alert status and generate event.

	* bin/pandora_snmpconsole: Updated call to execute_alert.

2007-10-01  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Perl standard interface for make (to install)

	* bin/pandora_db.pl: Some small fixes and information strings updated.

2007-07-31  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

        * util/snmptrapd: Deleted binary.

        * pandora_snmpconsole: Fixed startup scripts. Many checks added to
        manage NetSNMP Trap daemon. Now uses /usr/sbin/snmptrapd by
        default. Solved many problems. This also solve bug #1763691.

        * conf/pandora_server.conf: Added snmp_logfile token (before
        inside CODE!, UGLY!).

        * bin/pandora_network.pl: I hope Fixed BUG #1763305 with Master Server.

        * bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Support for config token snmp_logfile.

	on a new library for 1.4 or 2.0 version. Removed some debug
	commented code.

2007-07-18  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_network.pl: BugFix: SNMP calls that was causing segfauls was
 	because NetSNMP (SNMP) library is not thread safe !. Simple locking
	mechanism was enough to run code safely !. Main SQL sentence fixed,
	removed some debug code. 

	* pandora_server.conf: added sample of network_thread token

2007-07-17  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Added generic access to database using
	give_db_value() function.

	This should be definitive commit for Beta1
	
	* General cleanup of unused or old stuff.

	* bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Now uses errorlog for each perl
	error. Now render database bad connect string in connection phase
	(useful to debug startup errors by blank spaces).
	
	* util/pandora_checkdep.pl: Small perl script to check all
	dependencies.


2007-06-25  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	  perl modules to the perl directory instead of leaving them
	  in the pandora_server main directory.

2007-06-22  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

        * bin/pandora_recon.pl: This sould be final modifications for recon.

	* bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: alert_check function now support
	individual alert disable.

2007-06-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	Important update. Now all PM files (library) goes on PandoraFMS
	subdirectory from /bin. This should be copied/moved to system
	default Perl libraries (like /usr/lib/perl). All .PM files changes
	it's name.

	We also replace Net::Ping for Alive checks because recently
	problems discovered in packet lenght payload and problems with
	threads. We fallback to Net::Ping::External, now rewrapped to
	PandoraFMS::PingExternal and distributed with PandoraFMS for easy
	deployment.

	bin/*.pm: Renamed to equivalent files in ./bin/PandoraFMS dir
	
	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Now uses ping() from PingExternal to
	make alive checks. Latency checks is the only function that
	actually needs root now. External Ping could be executed from any
	user (it uses PING from system).
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS: Now contains all .PM files for PandoraFMS.

	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Now uses ping() from PingExternal.

	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Net::Ping::External does not solve our 
	odd problems. Fallback again to Net::Ping interface, not using a 
	double check to be sure that data is good. I hope this works :(

2007-06-05  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_network.pm: Small bug that causes some hosts to do not reply
	at ICMP request with a small payload (1 byte). Now uses by default 
	32 bytes per reply. Also modified icmp_data for latency checks because 
	was not using global timeout and has the same problems with small
	payloads.

2007-06-04  Raúl Mateos  <rmateos@netscape.net>

	data_inc modules, only updates if already exists. Fixed and
	tested.

	* pandora_network.pm: pandora_query_snmp() function return 0 if
	cannot stablish connection. Also, snmp_data_proc value of 2 (down)
	is turned to 0 for Pandora FMS. Also, now when cannot connect,
	ONLY UPDATE last_try field, not timestamp field in tagente_estado
	table. I don't know why was in that way until this moment ¿?

2007-05-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/pandora_db.pm: Fixed some problems with quotes and other
	aditional checks.

	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Fixed some problems with quotes and
	other aditional checks.  Detected a serious BUG in snmplib for
	Ubuntu Freeze
	(already submitted as detected BUG with veryhigh priority). This
	makes pandora network server unusable on feisty until fixed
	:(. Bug item is in
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/net-snmp/+bug/65047

2007-05-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	almost rewritten to fix a bug coming from 1.x? who causes to
	insert as data the total value for first data arriving... so bad
	:(. This is now fixed. crea_agente_modulo() now return id of
	agent_module created so we skip another timeconsuming query
	:). Added give_group_disabled() for next feature about Group
	Disabled doesnt fire alerts nor events. Fixed crea_agente_modulo()
	with many not defined checks.

	* pandora_network.pm: Fixed terrible bug in reference parameters
	that cause pandora_query_tcp() dont work properly.

2007-04-19  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_tools.pm: Now expor sqlWrap() function to parse " and '
	chars in some SQL sentences. Use with careful.

	* pandora_network.pm: Fixed little bug with undeclared variable
	warning.

	* pandora_db.pm: Implemented NEW text alerts with regexp. Internal
	audit now uses macros for alerts. Fixed a bug in
	crea_agente_modulo() when uses ' chars in name or module
	description (using sqlWrap to clean text). General code cleanup.

	available for any function in Pandora FMS Server.

	* pandora_db.pm: Several verbosity level adjustements in logger
	functions in all code. Some debug code purged. Alert code now
	should store group correctly in events. Renamed
	"processed_by_server" field from tagente_estado by "running_by",
	updated some code. pandora_updateserver() now stores also server
	version.

	* pandora_network.pm: pandora_serverkeepaliver now run more
	exactly and does not apply any delay. Module selection now uses
	utimestamp AND the new running_by to know that other instance of
	server is currently running this module. TCP code has moved to
	function pandora_query_tcp() -code cleanup-. UDP code deleted
	(doesn't work, and never used!). Fixed important bug in ICMP Proc
	that causes constant FLIPFLOP in monitors since last commit. Fixed
	also a problem from that version updating status timestamp. Lastry

	correctly recon server status in pandora_updateserver function
	call.

	Net::Ping library. This should fix many problems with some
	distros. Added pandora_ping_icmp() function to check ICMP boolean.

	* pandora_network.pl: Fixed problems with OID index. Perl needs to
	referente a .0 index, like SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 as
	SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr. Also, other numerical indexes are referenced
	different from system SNMP or PHP. IF-MIB::ifDescr.3 is
	IF-MIB::ifDescr.2 for PERL's SNMP.
